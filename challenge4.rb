#Start with an array of strings with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. Print every word in all lowercase letters.



words = ["PeppeR", "ShOw", "COat", "SeLECtion"]

words.each do |word|
    puts word.downcase
end


# I need to have an array with both upper and lower case letters, then run a code to print every word in lowercase letters. I need to run a .each method, and then the .downcase command on each word. After that I will have to print it to the terminal with a puts command.
